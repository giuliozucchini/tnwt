        <p>If you’re an average reader, I’ve got your attention for 15 seconds. Ads, multimedia items and links push you to leave the page that you're reading every second making concentrating on a single text a hard job.
        What if you could copy and paste the URL of the page you are reading and get back a proper, essential and clean page with the text you were reading?!
		<br />
		<br />
		This is the way you can read and save articles on The New Work Times.
    <br />
    <br />
    The New Work Times has been created in two weeks, during the Iron Hack bootcamp in Barcelona,
    by Giulio Zucchini. And the precious help of Llorenç Muntaner and Sharon Kennedy.
