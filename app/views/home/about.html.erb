        <p>If you are an average reader, you can keep your attention for 15 seconds. Ads, multimedia items and links push you to leave the page that you're reading every second making concentrating on a single text a hard job.
        What if you could copy and paste the URL of the page you are reading and get back a proper, essential and clean page with the text you were trying to read?
		<br>
    <br>
		This is The New Work Times: read, save and organize.
    <br>
    <br>
    The New Work Times has been created in two weeks, during the <b><a href="http://www.ironhack.com/" target="_blank">Iron Hack</a></b> bootcamp in Barcelona 2015,
    by <b><a href="http://github.com/giuliozucchini" target="_blank">Giulio Zucchini</a></b>. 
    <br/>
    And the precious help of <b><a href="http://github.com/s-kennedy" target="_blank">Sharon Kennedy</a></b> and <b><a href="http://github.com/lmuntaner" target="_blank">Lloren√ß Muntaner</a></b>.
